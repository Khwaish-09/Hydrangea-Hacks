        Well, it’s pretty depressing, and some mornings I wake up feeling very anxious before I even turn on the news
         (which I’m trying to do less often). But some of that could be about having recently turned 80 
         and the fact that my life partner, my late husband, 
         died a couple of years ago so we can’t cheer each other up any more. 
         I’m in the “high risk” range for the virus, old as I am and having asthma, although it’s a mild case.
        <br>
        I also find myself turning more to some pretty heavy reading, much of it about the nature of Time, 
        evolution, and what science tells us about the universe. I find the shift in perspective stimulating,
         absorbing, and of course distracting, in the best possible way.

        As pessimistic it might sound, Covid-19 has taken the worse toll on mental health. <br>
        Apart from physical distancing , 
        which already makes you a loner, many people are facing other issues like job hunting, recession, 
        some are dealing with layoffs, freshers are unable to apply for jobs and 
        students unable to apply for student visa for higher studies. <br>
    
        The list doesn't end here. Personal life is on a different level screwed up. 
        You have to stay home(which is necessary), 
        meeting friends has been in the form of video call and voice calls. 
        After 6 months, it has started escalating now. 
        The naive me thought due to pandemic and lockdown, at least people would stay in their homes 
        and crime rate would not increase. But boy was I wrong. Domestic violence cases has increases. 
        Riots, hate crime, everything is just THE SAME. Nothing has been changed on the positive scale. <br>
        Only good side I can think of right now is, people are working out, 
        those who are working at home have time for their families and can pursue their lost hobbies or 
        develop a skill. Freelancing is being encouraged and 
        more and more people are migrating towards part time jobs. <br>
        I think everybody should at least consider therapy when vaccine will be developed and 
        situation to be back to normal. This might take a while.

        It’s unfortunate timing — and not only because COVID-19 is ruining our social lives. 
        It’s also challenging because social isolation can actually make your depression worse.<br>
        What a letdown for a time of year that might ordinarily lift your spirits. 
        Personally, this isn’t my first rodeo with holing up and avoiding social interaction.
        For me, like for many people, self-isolation can be both a result and a cause of my depression.<br>
        When I’m feeling low, I dread socializing, convince myself that nobody wants me around, 
        and retreat inside myself so that I don’t have to risk the vulnerability of telling anyone how I’m feeling.
        But then I wind up feeling lonely, disconnected from the people I love, 
        and afraid to reach out for the support I need after avoiding people for so long.
        I wish I could say I’ve learned my lesson and avoid the temptation of self-isolation — 
        but even if that were true, now I have no choice but to stay home to avoid developing or spreading COVID-19.
        But I refuse to believe that it’s my civic duty to let depression get hold of me. <br>
        I deserve to protect my physical health without sacrificing my mental health in the process. And you do, too.
        You’re doing the right thing by practicing physical distancing. 
        But whether you’re at home with family, roommates, a partner, or by yourself, 
        being in the house day after day can take a toll on your well-being.
        Here are some ideas for making sure your CDC-recommended period of social isolation doesn’t turn 
        into an episode of debilitating depression. <br>
        1. Recognize that isolation can have a negative impact <br>
        2. Creating a routine can help <br>
        3. Take on a project that brings you joy </br>
        4. Rethink what it means to have a social life<br>
        5. The state of your home environment makes a difference <br>
        6. Therapy is still an option with phone and online services <br>
